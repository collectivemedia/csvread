Package: csvread
Title: Fast CSV file loader for R.
Version: 1.0
Author: Sergei Izrailev
Maintainer: Sergei Izrailev <sizrailev@collective.com>
Description: This package provides functions for loading large (10M+ lines) CSV
    and other delimited files, similar to read.csv, but typically faster
    than the standard R loader. While not entirely general, it covers many
    common use cases when the types of columns in the CSV file are known
    in advance. In addition, the package provides a class 'int64', which
    represents 64-bit integers exactly when reading from a file.
    The latter is useful when working with 64-bit integer identifiers
    exported from databases.
