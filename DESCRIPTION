Package: csvread
Title: Fast Specialized CSV File Loader
Version: 1.2.2
Author: Sergei Izrailev
Maintainer: Sergei Izrailev <sizrailev@jabiruventures.com>
Description: Functions for loading large (10M+ lines) CSV
    and other delimited files, similar to read.csv, but typically faster and
    using less memory than the standard R loader. While not entirely general,
    it covers many common use cases when the types of columns in the CSV file
    are known in advance. In addition, the package provides a class 'int64',
    which represents 64-bit integers exactly when reading from a file. The
    latter is useful when working with 64-bit integer identifiers exported from
    databases. The CSV file loader supports common column types including
    'integer', 'double', 'string', and 'int64', leaving further type
    transformations  to the user.
